 *	You are given a read-only array of N integers with values also in the range [1, N] both inclusive. 
 *	Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing. 
 *	The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers A and B where A repeats twice and B is missing.
 *
 *	
 *	Example 1:
	Input Format:  array[] = {3,1,2,5,3}
	Result: {3,4)
	Explanation: A = 3 , B = 4 
	Since 3 is appearing twice and 4 is missing
	
	Example 2:
	Input Format: array[] = {3,1,2,5,4,6,7,5}
	Result: {5,8)
	Explanation: A = 5 , B = 8 
	Since 5 is appearing twice and 8 is missing
	
	
	TC : O(N), where N = the size of the given array.
	SC : O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
	
	Approach : Step 1: Determine the size of the array.
		Step 2: Calculate the sum (Sn) and sum of squares (S2n) of the expected sequence.
		Step 3: Calculate the actual sum (S) and sum of squares (S2) from the given array.
		Step 4: Use mathematical formulas to find the missing (X) and repeating (Y) numbers.
		Step 5: Create an array to store the result and return it.
