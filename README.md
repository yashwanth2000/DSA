# DSA Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) programs implemented in Java. It covers a variety of topics. The programs are designed to help you understand and practice key DSA concepts and are suitable for educational purposes.
## Table of Contents

- Arrays
- bitManiplation
- Math
- Patterns
- Strings
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms


## Problem Sources

I'm actively working on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions from Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet and LeetCode.
