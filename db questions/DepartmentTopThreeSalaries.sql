Problem Description

Table: Employee
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
departmentId is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the Department table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.
 
Table: Department
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |

| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.
 
A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.
Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

Constraints:
There are no employees with the exact same name, salary and department.

Approach:
Using a subquery with `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to find the top 3 salaries in each department.

Intuition:
We want the top 3 salaries for each department. For each employee, we count how many distinct salaries in the same department are higher than theirs. If this count is less than 3, then the employeeâ€™s salary is among the top 3.

* We join `Employee` with `Department` to get department names.
* We use a correlated subquery to count higher salaries in the same department.
* Using `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` ensures duplicate salaries are handled correctly.
* `WHERE 3 > (...)` filters employees to only include the top 3 salaries per department.
* `ORDER BY` sorts the results by department name ascending and salary descending.
